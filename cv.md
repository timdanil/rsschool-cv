#### About Me

My name is Daniil, I am studying in Khabarovsk, namely at the Pacific State University, I am finishing my second year of master's degree and during my studies I realized that the knowledge that I received here will not help me become what I really want, namely the web developer, I'm really interested in this, since you are doing something from scratch and it pleases both you and those people who support you.On this course, I want to gain knowledge that will help me become a true professional and one step closer to my dream, thanks to rs for this opportunity

### Code Example
---
**Condition from CODEWARS:** *To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:volume = Length * Width * Height
But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!
It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).
Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.
Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).
Note: side will be an integer.*

>(let cubeChecker = function(volume, side){
	if(volume == side ** 3 && side > 0){
		return true
	} else {
		return false
	}
};).
